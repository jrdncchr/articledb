This is one of his way to make the show more funny, that he was nicknamed as a framer on the earlier episodes.\n\nBetrayer Kwang-soo, my favorite nickname for him. He is one of the Betrayer team composed of Suk Jin and HaHa, but he’s the worst if we’re talking about betrayal plays! He will do anything to win the race even if he’ll sacrifice his teammates for his own victory! His betraying concept makes the show more interesting and fun to watch.\n\nGiraffe Kwang-soo and Kwangvatar, this nickname was given to him because of his long legs that make him look like a Giraffe or an Avatar.\n\nThe Asian Prince, he was also recently called as the “The Asian Prince” because of his overwhelming popularity in other Asian Country.

So what exactly is this Running man?\r\n\r\nRunning Man\r\n\r\nBased on Wikipedia, Running Man is a South Korean variety show, It was first aired on July 11, 2010. This show was classified as an “urban action variety”; a never-before-seen new genre of variety shows focused in an urban environment like cities or towns. The MCs and guests complete missions in a landmark to win the race. The show has since shifted to a more familiar reality-variety show concept focused on games.\r\n\r\nDid you become interested? I know it’s a “No”, because I also did not get interested knowing that Running man is a Korean variety show. It got worse when I saw it on YouTube or on Facebook that the MCs are 6 middle aged men with 1 cute woman. I thought in my head, why will I watch this kind of show?\r\n\r\nSo what changed me to watch the show Running Man?\r\n\r\nThere was this friend of mine, who is always watching this show. He always invites me to watch this because it’s so funny, he said. I ignored him saying that it looks boring and no pretty girls to watch. But one evening in our friend’s home before starting a thesis work, He keeps on laughing so hard that got me and some of the group members to join him watch an episode of Running Man on his laptop.\r\n\r\nWe start watching and I got hooked when I saw my dream girl Im Yoona on the show! It got me and some of our group members interested and we continued to watch the show. We started laughing at the things they are doing and cursing how stupid the hosts are. Because it’s a variety show, they are trying to be funny. After watching that episode (ep. 63), It got me hooked and was unsatisfied with the ending, my friend said that it will continue with the next episode (ep. 64) which I watched it at home.\r\n\r\nHere is a link about the episode’s highlights that made me want to watch Running Man.', 'jordan', 'Entertainment', '2014-01-10'),

Now that the holiday season is over, I''ll also cut back to moderate wine consumption. Moderate wine consumption is still considered healthy and even medicinal by many doctors.\r\n\r\nIn order to enjoy the benefits of wine, such as its antioxidants and other health benefits, consider choosing reds over whites. But keep in mind that a moderate amount of alcohol (from white wines or beer), alcohol in general, is now believed to also be good for the body. Moderate alcohol is believed to raise high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the ''good'' cholesterol. Moderate alcohol is also believed to reduce the form of blood clots and help prevent artery damage caused by high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, the bad stuff.\r\n\r\nModerate wine consumption is defined as an average of 2 drinks per day for men and 1 drink per day for women. One drink is measured as 12 ounces (355 mL) of beer, 5 ounces (148 mL) of wine or 1.5 ounces (44 mL) of 80-proof distilled spirits.\r\n\r\nCrisp, dry white wines include Pinot Gris, Sauvignon Blanc, bone-dry Riesling, Vinho Verde and Soave. They can be partnered to a variety of healthy hors d''oeuvres to enjoy before your entree.\r\n\r\nEdamame is a green soy bean and should be considered a super food. It is a natural source of antioxidants and isoflavones. This bean is 36 percent protein, which is 86 percent higher than mature soybeans. It is high in vitamin C and B and E and contains calcium, manganese, iron, magnesium, phosphorus and copper. Edamame is also low in saturated fat and has no cholesterol.\r\n\r\nTo make a taste Edamame Dip, cook 1 (10 ounce) packages of edamame beans in a large pot of boiling, salted water for 3 to 5 minutes until tender. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the beans to a bowl of iced water. Return water in pot to boil again and add 2 (10 ounce) packages of frozen green peas. Heat up the peas for about 2 minutes. Transfer the peas to the bowl with the edamame beans. Let them cool. Working in batches in a food processor or blender, puree the beans and peas, adding vegetable oil as needed but sparingly to give the mixture a smooth texture. Also add into the blender 1/4 cup of fresh cilantro, 1/4 cup of fresh mint, 2 cloves of garlic, 1/2 teaspoon of ground coriander and 1/2 teaspoon of ground cumin. The most important ingredient is the lemon juice as it acts as a bridging ingredient between the dip and the wine. Add the fresh juice from 1 lemon. Transfer the pureed mixture to a clean bowl, cover and refrigerate until dinner time.\r\n\r\nThe tangy flavour of this dip, due to the lemon, harmonizes with the crisp acidity in all the wines listed above.\r\n\r\nLearn how you can transform an average dinner into a culinary journey of the senses by using the 3 Wine Pairing Secrets.

(6, 'Baby Shower Etiquette Ideas', 'Bed bugs have re-surged to become a very real problem in today''s world. Most people don''t know that bed bugs had a three decade vacation due to widespread treatments. However, the bugs have now found ample opportunity to increase in numbers and spread through multiple continents. The recent growth is primarily a result of increased travel. Bed bugs are traditionally found in high traffic areas such as hotels so the increase in travel has allowed the pests to take their own vacation once the frequent traveler heads back home. Learn how bed bugs can enter a home and learn how the infestation can be prevented using the following tips.\r\n\r\nWhat Are Bed Bugs? \r\nBed bugs are parasites that feed on the blood of people, using blood meals to grow and reproduce. They do not distinguish between dirty or clean homes and all people are vulnerable to infestations in their homes. They are also capable of feeding on animals, including all domestic pets. Bite responses can range from an absence of any physical signs of the bite to a serious allergic reaction. They are not considered to be dangerous; however, an allergic reaction to several bites may need medical attention.\r\n\r\nTips To Eliminate Bed Bug Infestations \r\nWash & Dry Clothing Immediately. Do not wait to wash travel clothes after a vacation or work trip. The pests can move quickly so perform laundry services immediately upon arriving back home. Clothes laundered in hot water or dried in temperatures hotter than 122° F for twenty minutes will kill all stages of the pests. This is typically the medium-high setting for a washing machine.\r\n\r\nWash All Food Containers. If traveling with plastic food containers, wash the containers before leaving the hotel. If washing the containers is impossible, make sure to wash them when arriving back home. The extreme temperatures inside a dishwasher will kill all bed bugs.\r\n\r\nAvoid The Hotel Floor.Try to avoid using the hotel floor for storage. Carpets in public places are breeding grounds for the pests so it may be a good idea to place plastic linings beneath luggage if forced to use the hotel floor. The hotel luggage stand can serve as great protection against any type of infestation.\r\n\r\nInspect The Mattress and Boxspring. There''s no better environment for a bed bug than a hotel mattress or boxspring. Many hotels have started using mattress encasements so do not tamper with the encasement if present. If no encasement is present, it''s a good idea to conduct a thorough inspection. Bed bugs can be difficult to spot but can be identified by the naked eye. They prefer to reside in tight spaces and they are extremely dark in color. Look for corners and tight spaces for the dark remnants of the bugs.\r\n\r\nCall A Professional Maid Service and Pest Control Company. It''s never a bad idea to receive a thorough cleaning of a home after returning from a trip. Most professional cleaning companies can disinfect a home and the deep cleaning will remove most of the remnants of the pests. If more action is required, call a pest control company to spray the home.\r\n\r\nBed bugs can be difficult to contain once they are allowed to roam freely. So, it''s best to utilize prevention techniques because more difficult techniques are required once they are allowed to build a presence inside a home.', 'admin', 'Home and Family', '2014-01-15'),

Millions are satisfied that the threat of danger from the fumes emitted from these cleaning agents goes away when the smell goes away.\r\n\r\nWhen any of these chemicals enter the body, they immediately go to the blood stream and begin penetrating cells within the body, and the tragic mutation has begun. Because every body is so different, it is impossible to know exactly the speed at which the mutated cell becomes apparent, and the manifestation of the mutated cell is identified. Once the cell is compromised from that initial contact, the damage to the body and the mind is done and cannot be undone.\r\n\r\nThe metastasis of the mutated cell is going to vary greatly with every body, but it is inevitable that some form or type of disease is steadily developing, and more often than not, culminating in death.\r\n\r\nLet''s be perfectly clear, these diseases are not limited to just the physical body, these diseases are manifesting themselves in the mind as well. Remember, blood is pumped throughout our entire system carrying these mutated cells.\r\n\r\nWe are witnessing today what was once considered an aberration, that being the killing of children by children. Mental disorder at every level of society, from the youngest to the oldest, and mental level, from the mild to the severe. The medical community has yet, the advanced technology that answers all of the questions about the makeup of the entire brain. The rapidity rate of the infection, along with other variables associated with, and affected by the compromised cell, is yet a long way from being answered.\r\n\r\nBecause of the higher and higher numbers of these disorders both physical and mental, and from earlier and earlier stages of life, the focus of attention is more and more being centered on the home and the cleaning agents regularly used. According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission on chemicals commonly found in homes identified 150 that have been linked to allergies, birth defects, cancer, and psychological abnormalities. In a study conducted over a 15 year period, men and women who worked at home; stay at home moms and dads, had a 54% higher death rate from cancer than moms and dads who had jobs away from home. Also, an EPA report concluded that the toxic chemicals in household cleaners are three times more likely to cause cancer than air pollution.

(28, 'The Fireplace and Home Fire Safety', 'Home heating fires account for 36% of residential home fires every year.\r\n\r\nIndoor fires can be dangerous any time of the year, but they can be particularly hazardous during the holidays, when around wrapping paper, decorations and holiday trees.\r\n\r\nBefore lighting your fireplace make sure that the flue is open and that there is no paper, gift wrappings or holiday decorations near the fireplace. Keep combustible materials such as paper, logs and kindling at least 3 feet away from the fireplace. Make sure that the Christmas tree is well away from the wood stove or fireplace. The excess heat will turn it into a dry torch.\r\n\r\n• Place the logs at the rear of the fireplace on a supporting grate and arrange the andirons to prevent any logs from rolling out. Always have the spark screen handy so that you can place it in front of the fireplace as soon as the fire has started. \r\n• Never use flammable liquids to start a fire. Use only seasoned hardwood as this will give off the least amount of creosote. \r\n• By building small fires they will burn more completely and will produce less smoke. \r\n• Never burn cardboard boxes, wrapping paper or other waste in your fireplace or wood stove. Never burn a Christmas tree in the fireplace. \r\n• Never leave a fire unattended. Extinguish the fire before going to bed or leaving the house. \r\n• Allow ashes to cool completely before disposing of them. Place the ashes in a tightly covered metal container and keep the ash container at least 10 feet away from your home. Ashes have a tendency to continue to burn, even after you think they are out. \r\n• Never empty the ash directly into a trash can; this is an open invitation for a fire to start.\r\n\r\nMaintenance of your fireplace is very important for fire safety. Fireplaces, just like anything else, wear out over a period of years and need to be maintained.\r\n\r\n• Have a professional chimney sweep inspect and clean the fireplace and chimney at least once a year. This maintenance is crucial to prevent creosote buildups and potential chimney fires. \r\n• Have a cap installed at the top of the chimney with a mesh screen spark arrester. \r\n• Keep the roof of your house clear of leaves, pine needles and other debris and remove any branches that may be hanging above the chimney. \r\n• Be sure to install both a smoke detector and carbon monoxide detector in your home and make sure the batteries are replaced. Keep a fire extinguisher on hand.\r\n\r\nRemember that a fireplace fire requires about 5 times as much air as most houses require for proper ventilation. With today''s tightly constructed homes, a fireplace can set up reverse draft that can suck poisonous carbon monoxide fumes from water heaters or other fuel burning devices in the house and discharge them into the living area.\r\n\r\nTo be safe, a positive source of outside air should be supplied to all fireplaces and wood burning stoves to bring in enough fresh air for efficient burning. This can be provided by installing an outside air vent or opening a nearby window when the fireplace or stove is being used.\r\n\r\nAllan Wright is a qualified writer with a keen interest in Family Health and Safety.

Writers have been inspired to revive these brain-dead creatures that have hit it really big. Sorry, Rick Grimes, but they have virtually invaded the world and there is no stopping them. They have movies, TV shows, and games!\r\n\r\nThus, came the PopCap Games sensational hit: Plants vs. Zombies. Initially designed for the OS X and Windows, it is now compatible with Nintendo, Xbox, Android, Blackberry, and Apple devices. Several versions have been released, including one for Facebook.\r\n\r\nDesigned to be simple enough for casual players to learn, yet challenging enough for hardcore gamers, Plants vs. Zombies has gained a following. In fact, it remains to be the fastest selling PopCap Games video game since 2009. The world is obsessed with Plants vs. Zombies-and zombies per se-that just about everyone you come across plays or knows it.\r\n\r\nSo, what''s so special about the game? Does anyone actually benefit from shelling out a couple of dollars to purchase the latest version released every year or so?\r\n\r\nIf you are skeptical about the long-term effects of gaming, you are not alone. Ever since video games came to be, a number of people-mostly adults-have condemned video games as a waste of time and money. This inspired studies to determine the impact of gaming. The results were remarkably positive, leading to the creation of digital learning tools.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, people learn faster when they''re having fun. Think about it. Would you rather sit through a three-hour lecture delivered by a monotonous speaker than learn Mandarin through an interactive app equipped with all sorts of fancy features?\r\n\r\nPlants vs. Zombies won''t teach you Mandarin, but it can improve your problem-solving skills. It immerses you into a virtual environment that simulates a probable life threatening situation-although exaggerated. You know it is superficial, yet you physiologically respond to it as though it''s real.\r\n\r\nHere are three key game features that can enhance your decision-making and other survival skills:\r\n\r\nWeapon Selection. You start out with a basic arsenal composed of sunflowers and pea shooters. As you move to higher levels, you unlock additional artillery. Simultaneously, you will be faced with armed zombies. To spice things up, you reach the point when you can arm yourself only with a limited number of weapons. This pushes you to weigh the pro''s and con''s of your choices.\r\n\r\nSite Challenges. Arsenal constraints. Tougher enemies. You''re just warming-up. The real challenge comes when the game introduces new environments. The absence of sunlight and a pool in the backyard increase the threats and hazards. This calls for flexibility in your part, enabling you to adopt to different conditions and adjust your weapon preferences.\r\n\r\nTime Pressure. Frankly, the pop-up warnings kill the suspense. Nonetheless, the game manages to bring in a number of conflicts that increase stress levels, ultimately testing your mental preparedness and alertness.\r\n\r\nThese three characteristics of Plants vs. Zombies are just a few of the many ways in which games serve as mental crunches. Still not convinced that gaming has its benefits? Or are you a wee bit encouraged to gift your kids the latest Xbox or Nintendo versions? The best way to win yourself over is to take the game for a test drive and find out for yourself.\r\n\r\nIn spite of being criticized as a mere distraction from the tedium, games have proven to be effective instructional tools. Just like Plants vs. Zombies, most video games are not intended to educate, but they can enhance skills necessary in solving real life problems.

They can also include purchasing in-game items with real money.\r\n\r\nFree-to-play\r\n\r\nThese ones are free to play online. They are typically supported by ads instead of subscription or purchases. The catch is that, most of them allow you to play a limited version of the game and if you love it, you can purchase the full version.\r\n\r\nBoxed games\r\n\r\nThey come on cartridge or disc, and are purchased online or in a store. You play them on a gaming device such as a console, PC or handheld. They can be of any nature including racing, shooting, adventure or sports.', 'admin', 'Gaming', '2014-01-15'),
(34, 'Board Games for Families With Kids', 'Families with kids need to think carefully before buying board games that would be fun and educational for the little ones and teenagers. Here are some popular board games that find pride of place in many families with kids:\r\n\r\n• Scrabble: You can build your kids'' vocabulary, and help them play with words with a wide variety of scrabble games available in the market. Depending on the age group, you can pick versions of this board game that are available in varied difficulty levels to suit anyone from nursery kids to young adults. For years, this wordplay has been a favorite with households all around the world and you too can have fun with your family by buying one.\r\n\r\n• Pictionary: If you love playing dumb charades, you will surely have fun of a different kind playing Pictionary where instead of acting out the answers as in charades, you will have to do it with drawings on paper. These board games are available in varying difficulty levels, and you usually get a pack of game board, pencils and paper, a timer, card deck, challenge die, standard die, and rules when you buy a game. This game tests how well a player can imagine and communicate under restricted circumstances.\r\n\r\n• Taboo: In this game, the trick is to give clues that are carefully-worded and creative, to help your team guess words quickly. However, you should refrain from using the obvious clues, which are strictly taboos. If you end up mentioning them, you will lose points. A taboo usually comes with a number of taboo cards, a card tray and cardholder, game-changer die, buzzer, sand timer and score pad. Four or more players can play this game.\r\n\r\n• Carom: This is one of the popular board games that can be played by 2, 3 or 4 players. Suitable for players aged 6 years and above, this social game can let people have some fun while pocketing the wooden pieces with the striker. So, if you would like to hone your carom skills and bond over the play, bring home a carom board and the required accessories today.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the most common board games prevalent in families with kids, though there are many other varieties of games that families can enjoy. All you need to do is opt for some research online to find the ideal game that you can play with your family and have a great time.', 'admin', 'Gaming', '2014-01-15');
